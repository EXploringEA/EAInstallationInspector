Source code for the [EXploringEA's EA Installation Inspector](https://exploringea.co.uk/tools/index.php/EAInspector/EAInspector.html) 

This is a windows application which displays registry entries associated with Sparxsystems EA Addins.

For more information review the document **eaInstallationInspectorInformationV7020.pdf** located under the resources directory.

Current release is V7.0.2.2 28MAY2023 - this release adds support to export registry entries that can be used to add/remove relevant EAddIn Keys - USE WITH CARE AND ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

I continue to tinker with the code do let me know if you find any issues or have suggestions on potential improvements.

Please NOTE: that the colours for indicating the condition of an AddIn has changed.  See https://exploringea.co.uk/tools/index.php/EaInspector/EaInspector.html for details - I'll try and keep the site updated - the documents are lagging behind at the moment,

A pre-built .exe and help file are provided under in folders below the root.  

* V7021 contains the current 32-bit/64-bit (note you now need the additional dll's in the same directory as the exe file if you wish to look at dll meta data)
