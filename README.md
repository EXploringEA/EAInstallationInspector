Current release is V7.0.0.7 17AUG2022 - this release includes support for the 64-bit version of EA and is evolving as more of the utility is tested.

The aim has been to provide a version that includes basic features and then update as more refinements are identified in relation to making it useful for both 32-bit and 64-bit work.

I continue to tinker with the code over the next few weeks as it is tested more and if you find any issues or have suggestions on potential improvements please let me know.

Please NOTE: that the colours for indicating the condition of an AddIn has changed.  See https://exploringea.co.uk/tools/index.php/EaInspector/EaInspector.html for details - I'll try and keep the site updated - the documents are lagging behind at the moment,

A pre-built .exe and help file are provided under in folders below the root.  

* V7007 contains the current 32-bit/64-bit (note you now need the additional dll's in the same directory as the exe file if you wish to look at dll meta data)
